## Description

This repository showcases different algorithms and operations implemented in JavaScript. It includes examples of array manipulation, sorting, and other programming concepts.

## Algorithms

### 1. Segregate Positive and Negative Numbers

The `segregateNumbers` function takes an array of positive and negative integers and segregates them without changing the relative order of elements. This ensures that positive numbers follow negative numbers while maintaining the same relative ordering.

### 2. Sort Numbers

The `sortNumbers` function sorts an array of numbers in ascending order using the built-in `sort` function.

### 3. Calculate Sum of Numbers

The `calculateSum` function calculates the sum of all numbers in an array.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository's directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. Run the JavaScript file:

   ```bash
   node your-script.js
   ```

4. Explore the different algorithms and their outputs.
