/*
-three algorithms are used:

1. Segregate Positive and Negative Numbers:
 The segregateNumbers function is used to segregate positive and negative numbers 
 from the input array while maintaining the relative order of elements.

2. Concatenate Arrays:
 The concatenation of the result array (containing negative numbers)
 and the positiveNumbers array (containing positive numbers) 
 can be considered a separate algorithm, 
 as it involves combining two arrays to create a new one.

3. Displaying Results:
 The code also includes displaying the segregated result in the console.
